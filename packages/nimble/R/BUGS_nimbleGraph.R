# The following roxygen is basically redundant with the method documentation for
# modelBaseClass::getConditionallyIndependentSets. Not sure we need both.

#' Get a list of conditionally independent sets of nodes in a nimble model
#'
#' Conditionally independent sets of nodes are typically groups of latent states
#' whose joint probability (density) will not change even if any other non-fixed
#' node is changed. Default fixed nodes are data nodes and parameter nodes (with
#' no parent nodes), but this can be controlled.
#'
#' @param model A nimble model object (uncompiled or compiled).
#'
#' @param nodes A vector of node names or their graph IDs that are the starting
#'   nodes from which conditionally independent sets of nodes should be found.
#'   If omitted, the default will be all latent nodes, defined as stochastic
#'   nodes that are not data and have at least one stochastic parent node
#'   (possible with determinstic nodes in between). Note that this will omit
#'   latent states that have no hyperparameters. An example is the first latent
#'   state in some state-space (time-series) models, which is sometimes declared
#'   with known prior. See \code{type} because it relates to the interpretation
#'   of \code{nodes}.
#'
#' @param givenNodes A vector of node names or their graph IDs that should be
#'   considered as fixed and hence can be conditioned on. If omitted, the
#'   default will be all data nodes and all parameter nodes, the latter defined
#'   as nodes with no stochastic parent nodes (skipping over deterministic
#'   parent nodes).
#'
#' @param omit A vector of node names or their graph IDs that should be omitted
#'   and should block further graph exploration.
#'
#' @param inputType The method of graph exploration depends on what the \code{nodes}
#'   argument represents. For "\code{latent}", the input \code{nodes} are
#'   interpreted as latent states, from which both parent and descendent graph
#'   exploration should be done to find nodes in the same set (nodes that are
#'   NOT conditionally independent from each other). For "\code{param}", the input
#'   \code{nodes} are interpreted as parameters, so graph exploration begins
#'   from the top (input) and explores descendents. For "\code{data}", the input
#'   \code{nodes} are interpreted as data nodes, so graph exploration begins
#'   from the bottom (input) explores parent nodes.
#'
#' @param stochOnly Logical for whether only stochastic nodes should be returned
#'   (default = TRUE). If FALSE, both deterministic and stochastic nodes are
#'   returned.
#'
#' @param unknownAsGiven Logical for whether a model node not in \code{nodes} or
#'   \code{givenNodes} should be treated as given (default = FALSE). Otherwise
#'   (and by default) such a node may be grouped into a conditionally
#'   independent set.
#'
#' @param returnType Either \code{names} for returned nodes to be node names or
#'   \code{ids} for returned nodes to be graph IDs.
#'
#' @param returnScalarComponents If FALSE (default), multivariate nodes are
#'   returned as full names (e.g. \code{x[1:3]}). If TRUE, they are returned as
#'   scalar elements (e.g. \code{x[1]}, \code{x[2]}, \code{x[3]}).
#'
#' @author Perry de Valpine
#'
#' @details This function returns sets of conditionally independent nodes.
#'   Multiple input \code{nodes} might be in the same set or different sets, and
#'   other nodes (not in \code{nodes}) will be included.
#'
#' By default, deterministic dependencies of givenNodes are also
#' counted as given nodes.  This is relevant only for parent nodes.
#' This allows the givenNodes to include only stochastic nodes.  Say
#' we have A -> B -> C -> D.  A and D are givenNodes.  C is a latent
#' node.  B is a deterministic node.  By default, B is considered
#' given.  Otherwise, other dependent networks of nodes that that depend on B would be grouped
#' in the same output set as C, but this is usually what is wanted.
#' Any use of the resulting output must ensure that B is calculated when
#' necessary, as usual with nimble's model-generic programming.  To
#' turn off this feature, set
#' \code{nimbleOptions(groupDetermWithGivenInCondIndSets = FALSE)}.
#'
#' @return List of nodes that are in conditionally independent sets. With each
#'   set, nodes are returned in topologically sorted order. The sets themselves
#'   are returned in topologically sorted order of their first nodes.
#'
#' @seealso There is a non-exported function
#'   \code{nimble:::testConditionallyIndependentSets(model, sets, initialize =
#'   TRUE)} that tests whether the conditional independence of sets is valid. It
#'   should be the case that
#'   \code{nimble:::testConditionallyIndependentSets(model,
#'   getConditionallyIndependentSets(model), initialize = TRUE)} returns
#'   \code{TRUE}.
