print function for use in nimbleFunctions
}
\details{
The keyword \code{print} in nimbleFunction run-time code will be automatically turned into \code{nimPrint}.  This is a function that prints its arguments in order using \code{cat} in R, or using \code{std::cout} in C++ code generated by compiling nimbleFunctions.
Non-scalar numeric objects can be included, although their output will be formatted slightly different in uncompiled and compiled nimbleFunctions.
}
\examples{
ans <- matrix(1:4, nrow = 2) ## R code, not NIMBLE code
nimPrint('Answer is ', ans) ## would work in R or NIMBLE

}
