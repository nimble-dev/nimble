\title{Convert CAR structural parameters to adjecency, weights, num format}
\usage{
as.carAdjacency(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Either: a symmetric matrix of un-normalized weights, or two lists specifying adjacency indices and the corresponding un-normalized weights.}
}
\description{
This will convert alternate representations of CAR process structure into
(adj, weights, num) form required by dcar_normal.  Two alternate
representations are handled:
}
\details{
A single matrix argument will be interpreted as a matrix of symmetric un-normalized weights;

Two lists will be interpreted as (the first) a list of numeric vectors
specifying the adjacency (neighboring) indices of each CAR process component,
and (the second) a list of numeric vectors giving the un-normalized weights
for each of these neighboring relationships.
