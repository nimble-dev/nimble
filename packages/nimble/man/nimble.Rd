\description{
A system for writing hierarchical statistical models largely compatible with
BUGS and JAGS, writing nimbleFunctions to operate models and do basic
R-style math, and compiling both models and nimbleFunctions via
custom-generated C++. NIMBLE includes default methods for MCMC, Monte
Carlo Expectation Maximization, and some other tools. The nimbleFunction
system makes it easy to do things like implement new MCMC samplers from R,
customize the assignment of samplers to different parts of a model from R,
and compile the new samplers automatically via C++ alongside the samplers
NIMBLE provides. NIMBLE extends the BUGS/JAGS language by making
it extensible: New distributions and functions can be added, including as
calls to external compiled code. Although most people think of MCMC as the
main goal of the BUGS/JAGS language for writing models, one can use
NIMBLE for writing arbitrary other kinds of model-generic algorithms
as well. A full User Manual is available at
