\usage{
testBUGSmodel(example = NULL, dir = NULL, model = NULL, data = NULL,
  inits = NULL, useInits = TRUE, debug = FALSE,
  verbose = nimbleOptions("verbose"))
}
\arguments{
\item{example}{(optional) example character vector indicating name of BUGS example to test; can be null if \code{model} is provided}

\item{dir}{(optional) character vector indicating directory in which files are contained, by default the classic-bugs directory if the installed package is used; to use the current working directory, set this to ""}

\item{model}{(optional) one of (1) a character string giving the file name containing the BUGS model code, (2) an R function whose body is the BUGS model code, or (3) the output of \code{nimbleCode}. If a file name, the file can contain a 'var' block and 'data' block in the manner of the JAGS versions of the BUGS examples but should not contain references to other input data files nor a const block. The '.bug' or '.txt' extension can be excluded.}

\item{data}{(optional) one of (1) character string giving the file name for an R file providing the input constants and data as R code [assigning individual objects or as a named list] or (2) a named list providing the input constants and data. If neither is provided, the function will look for a file named \code{example}-data including extensions .R, .r, or .txt.}

\item{inits}{(optional) (1) character string giving the file name for an R file providing the initial values for parameters as R code [assigning individual objects or as a named list] or (2) a named list providing the values. If neither is provided, the function will look for a file named \code{example}-init or \code{example}-inits including extensions .R, .r, or .txt.}

\item{useInits}{boolean indicating whether to test model with initial values provided via \code{inits}}

\item{debug}{logical indicating whether to put the user in a browser for debugging when \code{testBUGSmodel} calls \code{readBUGSmodel}.  Intended for developer use.}

\item{verbose}{logical indicating whether to print additional logging information}
}
\description{
\code{testBUGSmodel} builds a BUGS model in the NIMBLE system and simulates from the model, comparing the values of the nodes and their log probabilities in the uncompiled and compiled versions of the model
}
\details{
Note that testing without initial values may cause warnings when parameters are sampled from improper or fat-tailed distributions
