\title{Information on initial values in a NIMBLE model}
\description{
Having uninitialized nodes in a NIMBLE model can potentially cause some algorithms to fail and can lead to poor performance in others.  Here are some
 general guidelines on how non-intitialized variables can affect performance:
 \itemize{
   \item MCMC will auto-initialize but will do so from the prior distribution.  This can cause slow convergence, especially in the case of diffuse priors.
   \item Likewise, particle filtering methods will initialize top-level parameters from their prior distributions, which can lead to errors or poor performance in these methods.
}
