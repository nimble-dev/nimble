                        CHANGES IN VERSION 0.3-1 (Feb. 26, 2015)

USER LEVEL CHANGES

-- added Dirichelt-multinomial conjugacy handling

-- Added 'oldSpec' argument to configureMCMC. Allows rebuilding of MCMCs without the need to recompile code

-- Now allow for up to 4D arrays

-- Added handling of raising a vector of values to a scalar power in nimble functions (i.e., the NIMBLE DSL)

DEVELOPER LEVEL CHANGES

-- fixed naming issue in checking posterior summaries against known values in test_mcmc 

BUG FIXES 

-- fixed bug in naming of nodes in as.matrix() when there is a variable with a single indexed node (e.g. x[1], but no other nodes in the variable 'x')

-- fixed bug regarding logProbs with gaps (e.g., if logProb_x[1] and logProb_x[3] are defined but not logProb_x[2])

-- fixed bug in handling of unary minus

		  	CHANGES IN VERSION 0.3 (Dec. 31, 2014)

USER LEVEL CHANGES

-- IMPORTANT SYNTAX CHANGE: nimbleFunctions are run via myNimbleFunction$run() instead of myNimbleFunction(). This means code written in v0.2 and earlier will not run without adding $run. 

-- IMPORTANT SYNTAX CHANGES: 
  --- writing code for nimble models is now done with nimbleCode (previously modelCode)
  --- to customize MCMC use myMCMCspec <- configureMCMC(myModel) (previously MCMCspec)
  --- to build an MCMC algorithm, either myGenericMCMC <- buildMCMC(myModel) for a generic build or myCustomizedMCMC <- buildMCMC(myMCMCspec) for a customized MCMC algorithm can be used (previously one always had to build an MCMCspec, even for generic build)

-- Variables and methods of a nimbleFunction can be accessed by myNimbleFunction$myVariable or myNimbleFunction$myMethod() rather than nfVar(myNimbleFunction, ‘myVariable’) or nfMethod(myNimbleFunction, ‘myMethod’)(). Similarly, names of objects/methods of a nimble function can be queried by ls(myNimbleFunction)

-- faster compiling, most notably when compiling MCMC algorithms
 
DEVELOPER LEVEL CHANGES

-- Addition of graphIDs for logProbs for models (separate set than graphIDs for nodes) and graphIDs for modelValue variables

-- Addition of $expandNodeNames() for modelValues

-- $expandNodeNames() now evals nodeNames text array to quickly retrieve graphIDs.  expandNodeNames can also accept graphIDs and return names. Also can return multivariate nodes as either ‘x[1:10]’ or ‘x[1]’,’x[2]’, etc.

-- Addition of numberedObjects (both at R and C++ level) currently used for fast construction of C++ nodeFunctionVectors, modelVariableAccessors and modelValuesAccessors

-- Reduction of nimbleFunctions required for initialization functions of MCMCs

-- nimCopy now only requires that the number of nodes are equal, not that the sets of consecutive nodes be equal (i.e. previous nimCopy(…, nodes = c(‘x[1]’, ‘x[2]’), nodesTo = c(‘y[1,1]’, ‘y[2,2]’)) was not allowed). 

-- Addition of keywordProcessing system for more organized compiling of nimbleFunctions

Bug fixes

-- Fixed bug regarding calculating log probabilities for multinomial distribution with probabilities equal to 0


                     CHANGES IN VERSION 0.2 (Oct. 12, 2014)

-- Internal changes to decrease time to build models and nimbleFunctions.

-- Multivariate conjugate updaters are now included in the default MCMC implementation, as well as block updating on scalar and/or multivariate nodes.

-- Vector treatment of is.na and is.nan, so is.na(values(model, nodes)) will work, equivalently to any(is.na(...)) in R.

-- More extensive suite of tests.

-- Extension of node maps, which can be accessed via graphIDs, to increase speed of determining node types, checking if nodes in model, etc. 

-- model$getNodeNames, expandNodeNames and getDependencies all return the full node function name, i.e. if 'x[1:2]' is multivariate, will return 'x[1:2]' rather than 'x[1]', 'x[2]', unless returnScalarComponents = TRUE

-- Added class of nodeVectors, which save the graphIDs of a set of nodes. Use of these is minimal at the moment. 

BUG FIXES

-- Fixed issue with specifying multivariate nodes as rows/columns of matrices

-- Fixed bug in the conjugacy system

-- Fixed bug in compiled version of adaptive block updater

-- Fixed issue with building the NIMBLE package for Windows, as well as cleaning up causes of compiler warnings.

-- Fixed issue that values(model, nodes) sorted the outcome. Remaining bug to be fixed: nimCopy(nodesFrom, nodesTo) will NOT work if nodesFrom and nodesTo have different number/different lengths of ordered contingent blocks of memory, i.e. nimCopy(nodesFrom = c('x[1]', 'x[2]'), nodesTo = c('y[2]', 'y[1]')) will fail because nodesFrom is one block but nodesTo is two blocks

-- Fixed issue that chol(A+B) was being translated to chol(A) + B


                     CHANGES IN VERSION 0.1-1 (Aug. 28, 2014)


BUG FIXES

-- handling of spaces in installed directory name on Windows

-- ensured that various Makevars and Makevars.in and Makevars.win files are
  provided in the package for proper installation on all platforms
