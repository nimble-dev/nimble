NIMBLE has registered dmyunif as a distribution based on its use in BUGS code. Note that if you make changes to the nimbleFunctions for the distribution, you must call 'deregisterDistributions' before using the distribution in BUGS code for those changes to take effect.
Deregistering ddirchmulti from user-registered distributions.
Warning: random generation function for dfoo is not available. NIMBLE is generating a placeholder function that will invoke an error if an algorithm needs to simulate from this distribution. Some algorithms (such as random-walk Metropolis MCMC sampling) will work without the ability to simulate from the distribution.  If simulation is needed, provide a nimbleFunction (with no setup code) to do it.
