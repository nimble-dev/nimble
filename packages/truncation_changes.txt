last merge before added trunc/cens/constraint (trunc+) functionality was tagged as:
"fixed bug in dgamma altParams formatting", Sat Mar 07, ~3:50 pm

distributions_inputList.R:
this file now has element 'pqAvail' added to the (univariate) distributions that have p and q distribution functions available for computation
unrelated to trunc+:
chol changed to cholesky as name of parameter in dmnorm, dwishart 


distributions_processInputList.R:
added 'pqAvail' as field of distClass, plus initialize it with a line of code in distClass$initialize (line 77 of file)

distributions_implementations.R:
added {d,r}{interval,constraint}
unrelated to trunc+:
chol changed to cholesky as name of parameter in dmnorm, dwishart 

dists.h
added C_{d,r}interval
added {d,r}interval

dists.cpp:
add {d,r}{interval,constraint} functions
other non-trunc+ changes:
line 361: remove () from return
line 389: changed 'p' to 'prob' in comment
in ddirch, added give_log check in return when sumX > 1.0 + 10*DBL_EPSILON || sumX < 1.0 - 10*DBL_EPSILON

nimDists.{cpp,h}:
added overloaded nimArr_{d,r}interval

BUGS_modelDef.R:
add removeTruncationWrapping() and insertDistributionBounds() to modelDefClass$setupModel()
also, BUGSdecl$truncation added as argument to BUGSdeclClassObject$setup at lines 396, 419, 423, 493, 519
other non-trunc+ changes:
also note change to reparameterizeDists: "for(nm in c(nonReqdArgs, distRule$reqdArgs))" 
and block of code beginning line 1153 that prevents overwriting of data values by inits

nimbleFunction_nodeFunction.R:
addition of ndf_createStochSimulateTrunc() and ndf_createStochCalculateTrunc()
major changes to ndf_createStochCalculate() and ndf_createStochSimulate(), as well as ndf_createMethodList()
addition of addArg helper function

genCpp_operatorLists.R:
added nimArr_{r,d}interval to  callToSkipInEigenization
added distribution_{p,q}Funs objects, as well as pqAvail,pqDists
modified distributionFuns to include p and q funs

genCpp_sizeProcessing.R:
added nimArr_dinterval, nimArr_rinterval to sizeCalls and nimArr_rinterval to scalarOutputTypes

genCPP_processSpecificCalls.R:
added {d,r}interval to specificCallHandlers

BUGS_BUGSdecl.R:
added logical/comparison operators to nimbleOrRfunctionNames for use with dconstraint
added 'truncation' as field of BUGSdeclClass and as arg of setup method and processing of truncation in setup method

BUGS_readBUGS.R
changes specific for trunc+ are:
addition of processNonParseableCode to deal with T() and I()
block of code under the comment 'process model information' (line 226) has a bunch of changes to deal with processing of T() and I()
change mergeMultiLineStatements to mergeMultiLineStatementAndParse
but Cliff and I made other changes for Ryan's work and because data/constants issue now dealt with in BUGSmodel()

registration.R: 
added C_dinterval and C_rinterval

MCMC_conjugacy.R:
changed chol to cholesky as argument in dmnorm,dwish (this is to fix a bug that should have been changed before trunc+ merging)

NAMESPACE: added dinterval,dconstraint,node_stoch_dinterval,rinterval,rconstraint,node_stoch_dconstraint
(won't be necessary when rebuild NAMESPACE programmatically using prep_pkg.R but needed for now)


=== not done as part of trunc merging, but since Perry branched off ===

distributions_inputList.R, distributions_implementations.R
chol changed to cholesky as name of parameter in dmnorm, dwishart 

various changes in BUGSmodel, readBUGSmodel, modelDefClass$new, to deal with data/constants/inits
removed setData from RMakeCustomModelClass in BUGS_model.R
