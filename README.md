NIMBLE is an R package for programming with BUGS models and compiling parts of R.
[BUGS](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs) is a probabilistic programming language that makes it easy to rapidly develop hierarchical Bayesian models for statistical analysis.
NIMBLE provides an implementation of the BUGS language in R together with a DSL for writing custom inference algorithms against BUGS models.
NIMBLE's programming paradigm treats probabilistic graphical models as a basic programming construct.

## Installation

### Install prerequisites

NIMBLE needs a C++ compiler and the GNU `make` utility.
Additionally, Mac users need to have Xcode installed and Windows users need Rtools installed.
See the [User Manual](https://r-nimble.org/manuals/NimbleUserManual.pdf#page=26) for more details.

### Install NIMBLE

The easiest way to install NIMBLE is via CRAN:
```r
install.packages("nimble")
```

To install with extra functionality in `compareMCMCs` and `MCMCsuite`, install through the NIBMLE website:
```r
install.packages("nimble", type = "source", repos = "http://r-nimble.org")
```
