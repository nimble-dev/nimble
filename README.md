## Installation

NIMBLE can be installed in the usual fashion from CRAN, but Mac users need to have Xcode installed and Windows users need Rtools installed. Please see the User Manual for more details.

One can also install from the package version on our website; in general there is no need to do this, but some additional functionality in `compareMCMCs` and `MCMCsuite` is only available through the version on our website. To install from the website, invoke:
```
install.packages("nimble", type = "source", repos = "http://r-nimble.org")
```

Or use `R CMD INSTALL` after downloading from our [website](http://r-nimble.org/download-nimble).
