# More introduction {#cha:more-introduction}

Now that we have shown a brief example, we will introduce more about
the concepts and design of NIMBLE.  

One of the most important concepts behind NIMBLE is to allow a
combination of high-level processing in R and low-level processing in
C++.  For example, when we write a Metropolis-Hastings MCMC sampler in
the NIMBLE language, the inspection of the model structure related to
one node is done in R, and the actual sampler calculations are done in
C++.  This separation between *setup* and *run* steps
will become clearer as we go.


## NIMBLE adopts and extends the BUGS language for specifying models

We adopted the BUGS language, and we have extended it to make it more
flexible. The BUGS language became widely used in WinBUGS, then in
OpenBUGS and JAGS.  These systems all provide automatically-generated
MCMC algorithms, but we have adopted only the language for describing
models, not their systems for generating MCMCs.  

NIMBLE extends BUGS by:

  1. allowing you to write new functions and
distributions and use them in BUGS models;
  1. allowing you to define multiple models in the same code using
  conditionals evaluated when the BUGS code is processed;
  1. supporting a variety of more flexible syntax such as R-like
  named parameters and more general algebraic expressions.

By supporting new functions and distributions, NIMBLE makes BUGS an
extensible language, which is a major departure from previous
packages that implement BUGS.  

We adopted BUGS because it has been so successful, with over 30,000
users by the time they stopped counting
[@Lunn_Spiegelhalter_Thomas_Best_2009].  Many papers and books
provide BUGS code as a way to document their statistical models. We
describe NIMBLE's version of BUGS later.  The web sites for WinBUGS,
OpenBUGS and JAGS provide other useful documntation on writing models
in BUGS.  For the most part, if you have BUGS code, you can try
NIMBLE.

NIMBLE does several things with BUGS code:

  1. NIMBLE creates a *model definition* object that knows
  everything about the variables and their relationships written in
  the BUGS code.  Usually you'll ignore the *model definition*
  and let NIMBLE's default options take you directly to the next step.
  1. NIMBLE creates a model object^[or multiple model
    objects].  This can be used to
  manipulate variables and operate the model from R.  Operating the
  model includes calculating, simulating, or querying the log
  probability value of model nodes. These basic capabilities, along
  with the tools to query model structure, allow one to write
  programs that use the model and adapt to its structure.
  1. When you're ready, NIMBLE can generate customized C++ code
  representing the model, compile the C++, load it back into R, and
  provide a new model object that uses the compiled model
  internally.  We use the word 'compile' to refer to all of these
  steps together.


As an example of how radical a departure NIMBLE is from previous BUGS
implementations, consider a situation where you want to simulate new
data from a model written in BUGS code.  Since NIMBLE creates model
objects that you can control from R, simulating new data is trivial.
With previous BUGS-based packages, this isn't possible.

More information about specifying and manipulating models is in
Chapters \@ref(cha:building-models) and \@ref(cha:using-models).

## nimbleFunctions for writing algorithms {#sec:nimble-lang-writ}

NIMBLE provides *nimbleFunction*s for writing functions that can
(but don't have to) use BUGS models.  The main ways that nimbleFunctions can use
BUGS models are:


  1. inspecting the structure of a model, such as determining the
  dependencies between variables, in order to do the right
  calculations with each model;
  1. accessing values of the model's variables;
  1. controlling execution of the model's probability calculations
  or corresponding simulations;
  1. managing *modelValues* data structures for multiple sets of
  model values and probabilities.


In fact, the calculations of the model are themselves constructed as
nimbleFunctions, as are the algorithms provided in
NIMBLE's algorithm library^[That's why it's easy to use new
  functions and distributions written as nimbleFunctions in BUGS code.].

Programming with nimbleFunctions involves a fundamental distinction
between two stages of processing:


  1. A *setup* function within a nimbleFunction gives the steps
  that need to happen only once for each new situation (e.g., for each
  new model).  Typically such steps include inspecting the model's
  variables and their relationships, such as determining which parts
  of a model will need to be calculated for a MCMC sampler. Setup
  functions are executed in R and never compiled.

  1. One or more *run* functions within a nimbleFunction give
  steps that need to happen multiple times using the results of the
  setup function, such as the iterations of a MCMC sampler.
  Formally, run code is written in the NIMBLE language, which you
  can think of as a small subset of R along with features for
  operating models and related data structures.  The NIMBLE language
  is what the NIMBLE compiler can automatically turn into C++ as part
  of a compiled nimbleFunction.


What NIMBLE does with a nimbleFunction is similar to what it does
with a BUGS model:

  1. NIMBLE creates a working R version of the nimbleFunction.
  This is most useful for debugging (Section \@ref(sec:debugging)).
  1. When you are ready, NIMBLE can generate C++ code, compile it,
  load it back into R and give you new objects that use the compiled
  C++ internally.  Again, we refer to these steps all together as 'compilation'.
  The behavior of compiled nimbleFunctions is
  usually very similar, but not identical, to their uncompiled
  counterparts.


If you are familiar with object-oriented programming, you can think of
a nimbleFunction as a class definition. The setup function
initializes a new object and run functions are class methods.
Member data are determined automatically as the objects from a
setup function needed in run functions.  If no setup
function is provided, the nimbleFunction corresponds to a simple
(compilable) function rather than a class.

More about writing algorithms is in Chapter \@ref(cha:progr-with-models).

## The NIMBLE algorithm library {#sec:nimble-algor-libr}

In Version `r nimbleVersion`, the NIMBLE algorithm library includes:


  1. MCMC with samplers including conjugate (Gibbs), slice, adaptive
  random walk (with options for reflection or sampling on a log
  scale), adaptive block random walk, and elliptical slice, among others. You can
  modify sampler choices and configurations from R before compiling
  the MCMC.  You can also write new samplers as nimbleFunctions.
  1. WAIC calculation for model comparison after an MCMC algorithm has been run.
  1. A set of particle filter (sequential Monte Carlo) methods
  including a basic bootstrap filter, auxiliary particle filter, and
  Liu-West filter.
  1. An ascent-based Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEM)
  algorithm.
  1. A variety of basic functions that can be used as programming
  tools for larger algorithms.  These include:
  
     a. A likelihood function for arbitrary parts of any model.
     a. Functions to simulate one or many sets of values for arbitrary parts of any model.
     a. Functions to calculate the summed log probability (density) for one or many sets of values for arbitrary parts of any model along with stochastic dependencies in the model structure.
