# Welcome to NIMBLE {#cha:welcome-nimble}

NIMBLE is a system for building and sharing analysis methods for
statistical models from R, especially for hierarchical models and
computationally-intensive methods.  While NIMBLE is embedded in R, it
goes beyond R by supporting separate programming of models and
algorithms along with compilation for fast execution.  

As of version `r nimbleVersion`, NIMBLE has been around for a while and is reasonably
stable, but we have a lot of plans to expand and improve it.  The
algorithm library provides MCMC with a lot of user control and ability
to write new samplers easily.  Other algorithms include particle
filtering (sequential Monte Carlo) and Monte Carlo Expectation
Maximization (MCEM).  

But NIMBLE is about much more than providing an algorithm library.  It
provides a language for writing model-generic algorithms.  We hope you
will program in NIMBLE and make an R package providing your method.
Of course, NIMBLE is open source, so we also hope you'll contribute to
its development.

Please join the mailing lists
(see [R-nimble.org/more/issues-and-groups](https://r-nimble.org/more/issues-and-groups)) and help improve NIMBLE by
telling us what you want to do with it, what you like, and what could
be better.  We have a lot of ideas for how to improve it, but we want
your help and ideas too.  You can also follow and contribute to
developer discussions on the
[wiki of our GitHub
  repository](https://github.com/nimble-dev/nimble/wiki).

If you use NIMBLE in your work, please cite us, as this helps justify past and future funding
for the development of NIMBLE. For more information, please call `citation('nimble')` in R.

## What does NIMBLE do? {#sec:what-is-nimble}

NIMBLE makes it easier to program statistical algorithms that will run
efficiently and work on many different models from R.

You can think of NIMBLE as comprising four pieces:


  1. A system for writing statistical models flexibly, which is an
  extension of the BUGS language^[See Chapter
    \@ref(cha:writing-models) for information about NIMBLE's version of
    BUGS.].
  1. A library of algorithms such as MCMC.
  1. A language, called NIMBLE, embedded within and similar in style
  to R, for writing algorithms that operate on models written in BUGS.
  1. A compiler that generates C++ for your models and algorithms,
  compiles that C++, and lets you use it seamlessly from R without
  knowing anything about C++.


NIMBLE stands for Numerical Inference for statistical Models for
Bayesian and Likelihood Estimation.  

Although NIMBLE was motivated by algorithms for hierarchical
statistical models, it's useful for other goals too.  You could use it
for simpler models.  And since NIMBLE can automatically compile R-like
functions into C++ that use the Eigen library for fast linear algebra,
you can use it to program fast numerical functions without any model
involved^[The packages [Rcpp](http://www.rcpp.org/) and
  RcppEigen provide different ways of connecting C++, the Eigen
  library and R.  In those packages you program directly in C++, while
  in NIMBLE you program in R in a nimbleFunction and the NIMBLE compiler
  turns it into C++.].

One of the beauties of R is that many of the high-level analysis
functions are themselves written in R, so it is easy to see their code and modify
them.  The same is true for NIMBLE: the algorithms are themselves
written in the NIMBLE language.

## How to use this manual

We suggest everyone start with the Lightning Introduction in Chapter \@ref(cha:lightning-intro).

Then, if you want to jump into using NIMBLE's algorithms without learning
about NIMBLE's programming system, go to Part II to
learn how to build your model and Part III to learn
how to apply NIMBLE's built-in algorithms to your model.

If you want to learn about NIMBLE programming (nimbleFunctions), go to Part IV. This teaches how to program user-defined
function or distributions to use in BUGS code, compile your R code for
faster operations, and write algorithms with NIMBLE. These algorithms
could be specific algorithms for your particular model (such as a
user-defined MCMC sampler for a parameter in your model) or general
algorithms you can distribute to others. In fact the algorithms
provided as part of NIMBLE and described in Part III
are written as nimbleFunctions.
