for any quotes appearing in code (i.e., \cd), use ", not ' or `. 
Use of ' still appears a lot in actual R code and is fine, though ideally we might always use ".

If quoting in non-code areas (outside of \cd), use of `quoted' will print nicely in the pdf. We also use ``quoted'' in some places. 

Section X and Chapter Y not section X and chapter Y

use \cd{} when referring to actual code or names of functions or names of function arguments or named variables in code

use \nm{} (sparingly) when referring to names of concepts. In general only use once when first introducing the concept and not everywhere. E.g., \nm{nimbleFunction}, \nm{modelValues}, \nm{run} appear only when first introduced and then possibly later if one wants to re-emphasize the concept.

for comments in R code, use "## " at the beginning of the commented line

use <- for assignment in R code

put spaces around <- assignment in R, space between function arguments, spaces around = in argument setting, etc.

try to put in hard returns in R code to nicely space the printed R code and avoid overflowing the written area of the page
